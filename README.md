## Project: Visualizing the Orion Constellation

In this project, my alter-ego is Dr. Olivier Allain, a real-life astronomer for the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History. As an astronomer, part of my job is to study the stars. I've recently become interested in the constellation Orion, a collection of stars that appear in the night sky and form the shape of [Orion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation)), a warrior God from ancient Greek mythology. 

As a researcher on the Hayden Planetarium team, I am in charge of visualizing the Orion constellation in 3D using Matplotlib. The goal of the project is to understand spatial perspective.
